# maps-service-for-medical-platform-application

## Features of this service:
- **We built a map and map markers from scratch withoug google maps api so user can use the maps through the application**.
- **Once user opens the map page, we will ask the user for location permession, once user gives us the permission, we will show the location of the user at the center of the shown partition of the map, with red marker**.
- **Since that we aim to help users get valiable informations from our app with one click, User can click on `show all hospitals and clinics` and we will render all the hospitals and clinics that are signed on our application with blue marker for hospitals and green marker for clinics**.
- **Once user hover on any blue/green marker, we will show the entity name, phone contact, rate of this entity from users of our application**.
